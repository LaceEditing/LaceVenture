As you're chatting with your wife, the door swings open and a peculiar-looking stranger walks in, dressed in tattered robes and carrying an ornate staff. He approaches you, his eyes gleaming with an otherworldly intensity, and says, \"Greetings, Bob. I've heard rumors of a mystical 'Golden Cart' hidden within these aisles.
