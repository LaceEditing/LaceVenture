The air is filled with the scent of stale cigarettes from previous occupants.\n\nThe small bedside clock ticks loudly, marking time with relentless precision. A worn-out newspaper lies crumpled on the nightstand, hinting at the mundane events of yesterday.\n\nWhat will you do?"

The sun glints off a neon sign across the street.\n\nThe window's glass has a faint greasy film."
