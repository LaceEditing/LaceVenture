Flickering fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie glow on the Formica tables and vinyl booths. A haze of stale grease hangs heavy in the air.\n\nEvil Waitress glares at you from behind the counter, her eyes like two cold, dead fish. \"What can I scare you with?\" she hisses, her voice a rusty gate scraping against your spine.\n\nYou notice a plate of pancakes on the counter, steaming hot and emitting an otherworldly aroma. The diner's menu, if you can call it that, reads like a laundry list of culinary abominations: \"Poisonous Pancakes,\" \"Soulless Sausages,\" and \"Blood-Red Eggs.\"\n\nWhat will you do?"
