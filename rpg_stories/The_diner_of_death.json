A haze of stale grease hangs heavy in the air.\n\nEvil Waitress glares at you from behind the counter, her eyes like two cold, dead fish. \"What can I scare you with?\" she hisses, her voice a rusty gate scraping against your spine.\n\nYou notice a plate of pancakes on the counter, steaming hot and emitting an otherworldly aroma. The diner's menu, if you can call it that, reads like a laundry list of culinary abominations: \"Poisonous Pancakes,\" \"Soulless Sausages,\" and \"Blood-Red Eggs.\"\n\nWhat will you do?"

The words are indistinguishable, but the malevolent tone sends a chill down your spine. You can't shake the feeling that something is waiting for you in the darkness, watching and waiting for its chance to strike.\n\nThe house looms before you, a haven from the creeping dread that threatens to consume you. But as you approach the door, you notice something strange - the windows seem to be reflecting an image that doesn't belong. The figure across the street is standing just beyond the glass, their eyes burning with an otherworldly intensity.\n\nWhat will you do?"
