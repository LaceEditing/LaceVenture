The streets are alive with the sounds of laughter, chatter, and music wafting from nearby bars and clubs. As you walk along the sidewalk, taking in the sights and sounds of the city, you spot a small caf\u00e9 on the corner that seems like the perfect place to start your day.\n\nAs you enter the caf\u00e9, the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee fills your nostrils, mingling with the sweet scent of pastries. The cozy atmosphere is inviting, and you notice several patrons enjoying their morning coffee or working on their laptops. You make your way to the counter, where a friendly barista greets you with a warm smile.\n\n\"Good morning! What can I get for you today?\" she asks enthusiastically. Her name tag reads \"Kelly,\" and you can't help but notice how her slim figure is accentuated by her uniform. She looks up at you expectantly, awaiting your order.\n\nWhat will you do?"
